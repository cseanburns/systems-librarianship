<h2 id="introduction"><a class="header" href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>This short book is a work in progress.
A main, first draft should be completed by
the end of April 2023.</p>
<p>I am writing this book as I teach
a course on Systems Librarianship.
The book and course's goals are 
to provide a technical introduction to
the basics of systems librarianship
using Linux.</p>
<p>The course and book goals include:</p>
<ol>
<li>how to use the Linux command line in order to become more
efficient computer users and more comfortable with using
computers in general;</li>
<li>how to use cloud computing resources and create virtual
machines;</li>
<li>how to manage projects using Git and GitHub;</li>
<li>how to create a LAMP server, websites, and create a
bare bones OPAC;</li>
<li>how to install and configure content management systems,
and;</li>
<li>how to install and configure an integrated library
system.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="about-this-book"><a class="header" href="#about-this-book">About This Book</a></h2>
<p>The Systems Librarianship course is
a brand new course (2023).
I created the course to help future
and current librarians become proficient
in the kind of technology used to manage
and provide electronic resources.</p>
<p>Since I use this book for my
Systems Librarianship course,
which I hope to teach each spring semester,
this book will be a live document.
Each semester that I teach this course,
I will update the content in order
to address changes in the technology and to
edit for clarity when I discover some aspect
of the book causes confusion or
does not provide enough information.</p>
<p>A small part of this book will draw from
my course on
<a href="https://github.com/cseanburns/linux_sysadmin">Linux Systems Administration</a>,
which I teach in the fall semesters.</p>
<p>This book is not a
comprehensive introduction to
systems librarianship.
For example,
this book does not cover software coding nor
managerial duties, like issuing
requests for proposals for software products,
or budgeting.
It is designed as an entry level course in
the technical aspects of systems librarianship,
and it is meant to go hand-in-hand with 
other courses taught in our program.
That includes my course on
<a href="https://cseanburns.net/WWW/ERM-book/">electronic resource management</a>
but also other courses that my colleagues teach.</p>
<p>The book will start off as a series of transcripts, and
over time,
my hope is to build it out to a full fledged textbook
on systems librarianship.
I am using <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook">mdBook</a> to build this work.</p>
<p>The content in this book is open access and
licensed under the <a href="https://github.com/cseanburns/systems_librarianship/blob/master/LICENSE">GNU GPL v3.0</a>.
Feel free to fork it on <a href="https://github.com/cseanburns/systems_librarianship">GitHub</a> and
modify it for your own needs.</p>

<ul>
<li>Starts with an operating system called Multics.</li>
<li>Multics was a time sharing system
<ul>
<li>That is, more than one person could use it at once.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But Multics had issues and was slowly abandoned</li>
<li><a href="http://cs.bell-labs.co/who/ken/">Ken Thompson</a> found an old PDP-7. Started to write UNIX.
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_(text_editor)">ed</a> line editor was written.</li>
<li>Pronounced e.d. but generally sounded out.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This version of UNIX would later be referred to as <em>Research Unix</em></li>
<li><a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/">Dennis Ritchie</a>, the creator of the C programming language,
joined Thompson's efforts.</li>

<ul>
<li>The code for UNIX was not 'free software'
but low cost and easily shared.</li>
<li>Ken Thompson visited Berkeley and helped install <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution">Version 6 of UNIX</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Joy">Bill Joy</a> and others contributed heavily
<ul>
<li>Joy created the <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/bostic.com/keithbostic/vi/">vi</a> text editor,
a descendant of the popular <a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> editor,
many other important programs, and was a co-founder of Sun Microsystems</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This installation of UNIX would eventually become known
as the Berkeley Software Distribution, or BSD.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="att"><a class="header" href="#att">AT&amp;T</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Until its breakup in 1984,
AT&amp;T was not allowed to profit off patents
that were not directly related to its telecommunications businesses.</li>
<li>This agreement with the US government helped
protect the company from monopolistic charges,
and as a result, they could not commercialize UNIX.</li>
<li>This changed after the breakup.
System V UNIX became the standard bearer of commercial UNIX.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>In the late 1970s, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman">Richard Stallman</a> noticed
that software began to become commercialized.
<ul>
<li>As a result, hardware vendors stopped sharing
the code they developed to make their hardware work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Software code became eligible for copyright protection with
the Copyright Act of 1976</li>
<li>Stallman, who thrived in a <em>hacker culture</em>,
began to battle against this turn of events.</li>
<li>Stallman created the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu.html">GNU project</a>,
the free software philosophy, GNU Emacs,
a popular and important text editor,
and he wrote many other programs.</li>
<li>The GNU project is an attempt to create a completely
<strong>free software</strong> operating system,
that was Unix-like, called GNU.</li>
<li>By the early 1990s, Stallman and others had developed
all the utilities needed to have a full operating system,
except for a kernel, which they called <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/">GNU Hurd</a>.</li>
<li>This included the Bash shell, written by <a href="https://opuslogica.com/">Brian Fox</a>.</li>
<li>The GNU philosophy includes several propositions
that define free software:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The four freedoms, per GNU Project:
0. The freedom to run the program as you wish,
for any purpose (freedom 0).</p>
<ol>
<li>The freedom to study how the program works,
and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1).
Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</li>
<li>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2).</li>
<li>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified
versions to others (freedom 3).
By doing this you can give the whole community a chance
to benefit from your changes.
Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>AT&amp;T, after its breakup, began to commercialize Unix,
and differences in AT&amp;T Unix and BSD Unix arose.</li>
<li>The former was aimed at commercialization,
and the latter aimed at researchers and academics.</li>
<li>UNIX Systems Laboratories, Inc. (USL, part of AT&amp;T)
sued Berkeley Software Design, Inc.
(BSDi, part of the University of California, Berkeley)
for copyright and trademark violations.</li>
<li>USL ultimately lost the case,
but the lawsuit delayed adoption of BSD Unix.</li>

<ul>
<li>On August 25, 1991, <a href="https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/torvalds/">Linus Torvalds</a>
announced that he had started working on a <strong>free</strong>
operating system kernel for the 386 CPU architecture
and for his specific hardware.</li>
<li>This <a href="https://www.kernel.org/">kernel</a> would later be named <strong>Linux</strong>.</li>
<li>Linux technically refers only to the kernel.
<ul>
<li>An operating system kernel handles startup,
devices, memory, resources, etc.</li>
<li>A kernel does not provide user land utilities---the
kinds of software they people use when using computers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Torvalds' motivation was to learn about OS development
but also to have access to a Unix-like system.
<ul>
<li>He already had access to an Unix-like system
called <a href="https://www.minix3.org/">MINIX</a>,
but MINIX had technical and copyright restrictions.</li>

<h2 id="the-linux-kernel"><a class="header" href="#the-linux-kernel">The Linux Kernel</a></h2>
<p>Technically, <a href="https://kernel.org/">Linux is a kernel</a>, and
a kernel is a part of an operating system that
oversees CPU activity like multitasking, as well as networking,
memory management, device management, file systems, and more.
The kernel alone does not make an operating system.
It needs user land applications and programs,
the kind we use on a daily basis, to form a whole,
as well as ways for these user land utilities to
interact with the kernel.</p>
<h2 id="linux-and-gnu"><a class="header" href="#linux-and-gnu">Linux and GNU</a></h2>
<p>The earliest versions of the Linux kernel were combined
with tools, utilities, and programs from the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/software.html">GNU project</a>
to form a complete operating system,
without necessarily a graphical user interface.
This association continues to this day.
Additional non-GNU, but
free and open source programs under different licenses,
have been added to form a more functional and user friendly system.
However, since the Linux kernel needs user land applications
to form an operating system, and
since user land applications from GNU cannot work without a kernel,
some argue that the operating system
should be called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU/Linux_naming_controversy">GNU/Linux</a>
and not just Linux.
This has not gained wide acceptance, though.
Regardless, credit is due to both camps for their contribution,
as well as many others who have made substantial contributions
to the operating system.</p>
<h2 id="linux-uses"><a class="header" href="#linux-uses">Linux Uses</a></h2>
<p>We are using Linux as a server in this course, which
means we will use Linux to provide various services.
Our first focus is to learn to use Linux itself, but
by the end of the course,
we will also learn how to provide web and database services.
Linux can be used to provide <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)">other services</a> that
we won't cover in this course, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>file servers</li>
<li>mail servers</li>
<li>print servers</li>
<li>game servers</li>
<li>computing servers</li>
</ul>
<p>Although it's a small overall percentage,
many people use Linux as their main
desktop/laptop operating system.
I belong in this camp.
Linux has been my main OS since the early 2000s.
While our work on the Linux server means that we will
almost entirely work on the command line,
this does not mean that my Linux
desktop environment is all command line.
In fact, there are many graphical user environments,
often called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment">desktop environments</a>,
available to Linux users.
Since I'm currently using the Ubuntu Desktop distribution,
my default desktop environment is called <a href="https://www.gnome.org/">Gnome</a>.
<a href="https://kde.org/">KDE</a> is another popular desktop environment, but
there are many other attractive and useful ones.
And it's easy to install and switch between
multiple ones on the same OS.</p>
<p>Linux has become quite a pervasive operating system.
Linux powers the hundreds of the
fastest supercomputers in the world.
It, or other Unix-like operating systems,
are the foundation of most web servers.
The Linux kernel also forms the basis of the Android
operating system and of Chrome OS.
The only place where Linux does not dominate is
in the desktop/laptop space.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-1"><a class="header" href="#introduction-1">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>What is systems administration or
who is a systems administrator (or <strong>sysadmin</strong>)?
Let's start off with some definitions provided by
the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An individual, group, or organization responsible for setting up and
maintaining a system or specific system elements, implements approved secure
baseline configurations, incorporates secure configuration settings for IT
products, and conducts/assists with configuration monitoring activities as
needed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Individual or group responsible for overseeing the day-to-day operability of a
computer system or network. This position normally carries special privileges
including access to the protection state and software of a system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See: <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/system_administrator">Systems Administrator @NIST</a></p>
<h2 id="specialized-positions"><a class="header" href="#specialized-positions">Specialized Positions</a></h2>
<p>In addition to the above definitions,
which broadly define the role,
there are a number of related or specialized positions.
We'll touch on the first three in this course:</p>
<ul>
<li>Web server administrator:
<ul>
<li>&quot;web server administrators are system architects responsible for the
overall design, implementation, and maintenance of Web servers. They may or
may not be responsible for Web content, which is traditionally the
responsibility of the Webmaster (<a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/web_server_administrator">Web Server Administrator&quot;
@NIST</a>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Database administrator:
<ul>
<li>like web admins, and to paraphrase above, database administrators are system
architects responsible for the overall design, implementation, and
maintenance of database management systems. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Network administrator:
<ul>
<li>&quot;a person who manages a network within an organization. Responsibilities
include network security, installing new applications, distributing software
upgrades, monitoring daily activity, enforcing licensing agreements,
developing a storage management program, and providing for routine backups&quot;
(<a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/network_administrator">Network Administrator @NIST</a>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mail server administrator:
<ul>
<li>&quot;mail server administrators are system architects responsible for the
overall design and implementation of mail servers&quot; (<a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/mail_server_administrator">Mail Server
Administrators @NIST</a>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on where a system administrator works,
they may specialize in any of the above administrative areas, or
if they work for a small organization,
all of the above duties may be rolled into one position.
Some of the positions have evolved quite a bit over the last
couple of decades.
For example, it wasn't too long ago when organizations would
operate their own mail servers, but
this has largely been outsourced to third-party providers,
such as Google (via Gmail) and Microsoft (via Outlook).
People are still needed to work with these
third-party email providers, but
the nature of the work is different than operating
independent mail servers.</p>
<h2 id="certifications"><a class="header" href="#certifications">Certifications</a></h2>
<p>It's not always necessary to get certified
as a systems administrator to get work as one, but
there might be cases where it is necessary; for example,
in government positions or in large corporations.
It also might be the case that you can get work
as an entry level systems administrator and
then pursue certification with
the support of your organization.</p>
<p>Some common starting certifications are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/services/certification/rhcsa">Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.comptia.org/certifications/server">CompTIA Server+</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.comptia.org/certifications/a">CompTIA A+</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Plus, Google offers, via <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a>, a
beginners <a href="https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-it-support">Google IT Support Professional Certificate</a>
that may be helpful.</p>
<h2 id="associations"><a class="header" href="#associations">Associations</a></h2>
<p>Getting involved in associations and related
organizations is a great way to learn and
to connect with others in the field.
Here are few ways to connect.</p>
<p><a href="https://lopsa.org/AboutLOPSA">LOPSA</a>, or
The League of Professional System Administrators,
is a non-profit association that seeks to advance
the field and membership is free for students.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.acm.org/">ACM</a>, or the Association for Computing Machinery,
has a number of relevant
<a href="https://www.acm.org/special-interest-groups/alphabetical-listing">special interest groups (SIGs)</a>
that might be beneficial to systems administrators. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.npa.org/">NPA</a>, or the Network Professional Association,
is an organization that &quot;supports IT/Network 
professionals.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="codes-of-ethics"><a class="header" href="#codes-of-ethics">Codes of Ethics</a></h2>
<p>Systems administrators manage computer systems
that contain a lot of data about us and
this raises privacy and competency issues,
which is why some have created code of ethics statements.
Both LOPSA and NPA have created such statements
that are well worth reviewing and discussing.</p>
<ul>
<li>LOPSA: <a href="https://lopsa.org/CodeOfEthics">Code of Ethics</a></li>
<li>NPA: <a href="https://www.npa.org/public/about_codeofethics.cfm">Code of Ethics</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="keeping-up"><a class="header" href="#keeping-up">Keeping Up</a></h2>
<p>Technology changes fast.
In fact, even though I teach this course
about every year,
I need to revise the
course each time, sometimes substantially,
to reflect changes that have developed
over short periods of time.
It's also your responsibility,
as sysadmins,
to keep up, too.</p>
<p>I therefore suggest that you continue your
education by reading and practicing.
For example, there are lots of books on 
systems administration.
<a href="https://www.npa.org/public/about_codeofethics.cfm">O'Reilly</a> continually
publishes on the topic.
RedHat,
the makers of the Red Hat Linux distribution,
and sponsors of <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/">Fedora Linux</a> and
<a href="https://centos.org/">CentOS Linux</a>,
provides the <a href="https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/">Enable Sysadmin</a> site,
with new articles each day,
authored by systems administrators,
on the field.
Opensource.com, also supported by Red Hat,
<a href="https://opensource.com/tags/sysadmin">publishes articles on systems administration</a>.
<a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/command-line-heroes">Command Line Heroes</a> is a fun and
informative podcast on technology and
sysadmin related topics.
<a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/">Linux Journal</a> publishes great articles
on Linux related topics.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a class="header" href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>In this section I provided definitions of systems administrators
and also the related or more specialized positions,
such as database administrator, network administrator,
and others.</p>
<p>I provided links to various certifications you might
pursue as a systems administrator, and
links to associations that might benefit you and your career.</p>
<p>Technology manages so much of our daily lives, and
computer systems store lots of data about us.
Since systems administrators manage these systems,
they hold a great amount of responsibility
to protect them and our data.
Therefore, I provided links to two code of ethics
statements that we will discuss.</p>
<p>It's also important to keep up with the technology,
which changes fast.
The work of a systems administrator is much different
today than it was ten or twenty years ago, and
that surely indicates that it could be much different in
another ten to twenty years.
If we don't keep up,
we won't be of much use to the people we serve.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="what-is-systems-librarianship"><a class="header" href="#what-is-systems-librarianship">What is Systems Librarianship</a></h1>
<h2 id="introduction-2"><a class="header" href="#introduction-2">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Of course, let's begin with the question,
what is systems librarianship?
Normally we might go to the literature
to answer a question like this.
Indeed, the literature is helpful,
but it's sparse.
The <a href="https://libguides.uky.edu/803">LISTA</a> database only
returns 131 results
with a 45 year coverage
for a search using the thesauri term
<strong>SYSTEMS Librarians</strong>.
I can get more results if I expand
the search query, but
then I get less relevant results, and
the main idea is the same:
this is an understudied area of
librarianship.</p>
<p>It's been that way for a while.
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1300/J111v09n04_06">Susan K. Martin</a>
wrote the following over 35 years ago:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of the specialist positions that exist in libraries, none
is as underexamined as those of the systems
librarians---the people who identify the needs of the
library for automated systems, cause these systems to be
implemented, and analyze the operations of the library (p.
57).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps as a result of this
underexamination,
sometimes there is confusion around
the requirements and skills needed in
this area of librarianship.
Martin (1988) captured this tension
when she wrote the following in 1988,
which is still true today:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the years the library world has argued whether
systems librarians should be librarians who have learned
information technologies, or computer experts who have
learned about libraries (p. 61).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The argument is partly
a matter of jurisdiction.
<a href="https://www.proquest.com/docview/220452054/abstract/A48FC30B10D94886PQ/1?accountid=11836">Abbott (1998)</a>,
writing on librarianship in the sociology of professions,
illustrated how:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The future of librarianship thus hinges on what happens to
the perpetually changing work of the profession in its
three contexts: the context of larger social and culture
forces, the context of other competing occupations, and
the context of competing organizations and commodities. To
these complex contextual forces, any profession responds
with varying policies and internal changes (pp. 434-5).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Essentially, Abbott means that professions,
like librarianship,
are always changing.
The mechanisms for that change are
structural and cultural <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/40664150">(Abbott, 2010)</a>,
but a changing profession means that
its &quot;link of jurisdiction&quot;
(Abbott, 1998, p. 435) changes, too.
It not only changes, but
professions constantly compete with each
other over to adopt new areas
of jurisdiction.
So when we ask,
as Martin (1998) did,
whether librarians should learn
information technologies or whether
computer experts should learn libraries,
I find myself thinking the prior is
more important for libraries
and their patrons.
It means that librarians are expanding
their jurisdiction by also becoming
computer experts rather than
computer experts expanding theirs.</p>
<p>That leads us to the next questions:
what does it mean to be a computer
expert for a systems librarian?
What does a systems librarians need
to do and know?</p>
<p>The answer is that it is a mix.
Some part of the work involves
systems administration, but
that has broad meanings, and
systems librarianship is more specific.
Or, it has a more specific domain:
the domain of libraries and librarianship.</p>
<p>A systems librarian might thus be considered
a library systems administrator.
Under this view, they need to be someone
who knows about libraries,
how libraries work,
what they do,
about their patrons,
what their values are,
and then use that knowledge to build
the infrastructure to support that.</p>
<p>Given this, and the technologies involved,
such work requires constant learning.
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1108/07378830310494445">Jordan (2003)</a> 
identified three areas of learning:</p>
<ul>
<li>pre-service education in library schools</li>
<li>on the job training</li>
<li>professional development in the form of workshops,
courses, and conferences (p. 273)</li>
</ul>
<p>Pre-service, formal education is a small part
of any professional's career,
regardless if that profession is
in medicine, law, or librarianship.
Thus the goal of pre-service
education is to prepare people
to adapt and grow in their fields.
Jordan (2003) wrote that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While formal training is undoubtedly important, the
ability to learn new technologies independently lies at
the foundation of systems librarians' professional life,
because they often have to use technologies, or make
planning decisions about specific technologies, before
they become common enough to be the subject of formal
training sessions (p. 273).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even though Jordan's article
is 20 years old and
the technology has changed a lot,
the basic duties of the systems librarian
remain the same
(Fu, 2014; <a href="https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781538107133/Systems-Librarianship-A-Practical-Guide-for-Librarians">Gonzales, 2020</a>).
<a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/1038159656">Wilson (1998)</a>,
as cited in Jordan (2003),
refers to a list of the
&quot;typical responsibilities of systems librarians.&quot;
These responsibilities look different today,
because the technology is different,
but conceptually,
they're the same as they were then.
In fact, this work will focus
on a subset of this list that includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>integrated library system management</li>
<li>server management</li>
<li>documentation</li>
<li>technology exploration and evaluation (Jordan, 2003, p. 274)</li>
</ul>
<p>Gonzales (2020) highlights these and
more current areas that include:</p>
<ul>
<li>content management systems</li>
<li>electronic resource management systems</li>
<li>website redesign</li>
<li>help and support</li>
</ul>
<p>Other items on Jordan's (2003) list are
still relevant, but
due to various constraints,
this work will not cover the following
areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>network design and management</li>
<li>desktop computing</li>
<li>application development</li>
<li>planning and budget</li>
<li>specification and purchasing</li>
<li>miscellaneous technology support</li>
<li>technical risk management (p. 274)</li>
</ul>
<p>In short,
this work specifically focuses on
a few of the bigger technical aspects of
systems librarianship.
Other works (or courses) and
other sources will provide learning
opportunities on the more
managerial and administrative functions
of systems librarianship and librarianship, in general.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are interested in learning
more about network design and administration,
then I encourage you to read my chapters on
<a href="https://cseanburns.net/WWW/linux-systems-admin/19-networking-tcpip.html">Networking and TCP/IP</a> and
<a href="https://cseanburns.net/WWW/linux-systems-admin/20-dns-domain-names.html">DNS and Domain Names</a> in my
book on
<a href="https://cseanburns.net/WWW/linux-systems-admin/">Systems Administration with Linux</a>.</p>
<p>If you are interested in learning about
application development,
then you can pursue courses in a variety
of programming languages,
such as R, Python, JavaScript, and PHP,
as well as courses on relational databases,
such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, and so forth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Jordan (2003) identified,
there is a lack of formalized training
in systems librarianship in LIS schools.
This is as true today as it was in 2003.
This course was created to address the
lack of that training.
However, it can only be a start.
Technology is constantly changing, and
that means we must always embrace more
informal learning opportunities.
LIS programs are only two or so years
long (if attending full time), but
our careers, hopefully, will span decades.
So all this course can ever be
is just a starting point.</p>
<p>It is a big start, though.
This course should lay a strong foundation for
self-growth and self-education
in the variety of technologies
that we will learn and use here.
Although separate areas of librarianship,
my work (and course) on
<a href="https://cseanburns.net/WWW/ERM-book/">electronic resource management</a>
complement this one in many ways.
For example, this work supports several
parts of the technology section in the
<a href="https://www.nasig.org/Competencies-Eresources">NASIG Core Competencies for Electronic Resources
Librarians</a>.
It is no coincidence these two areas of
librarianship often overlap or are
assumed in a single librarian position.</p>
<h2 id="cloud-computing"><a class="header" href="#cloud-computing">Cloud Computing</a></h2>
<p>Lastly, I want to mention cloud computing.
This has become a major area of change in
the last decade or so.
It used to be more common for librarians
to install their integrated library system software
and store their bibliographic data on their premises.
In the last ten years,
there has been more migration to the cloud,
which means that both the integrated library system
software and the bibliographic data are stored off-site.
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1108/10650751311294528">Liu &amp; Cai (2013)</a> highlight the beginning
of this trend toward cloud computing
that continues to play a large role in
systems librarianship <a href="https://doi.org/10.1108/DLP-03-2021-0022">(Naveed et al., 2021)</a>.
As Liu and Cai note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Systems librarians used to make their livings by managing
hosted library systems. This situation is silently
changing with the library systems moving onto the cloud
(p. 26).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This trend has changed some aspects of
systems librarianship.
It means that systems librarians,
while still a technical area of librarianship,
need to work more closely with the vendors
who themselves are hosting library systems.
However, the trend does not erase all
locally hosted solutions.
Many libraries and other information agencies
continue to support local collections and
will either host those locally or work
to get the bibliographic information for those
collections ingested into their cloud-based
integrated library systems.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-1"><a class="header" href="#conclusion-1">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>The remainder of the course
will be more technical and
will prepare you to work and understand the
systems that support the modern library.
We will cover a lot, too!
We will begin with setting up
virtual machine instances on Google Cloud.
We will use a distribution of the Linux
operating system for these virtual machines.
We will then learn the basics of the
Linux command line.
Next, we will learn how to use
the version control system called <code>git</code>.
We will use <code>git</code> to document our work flows and
push that documentation to <a href="https://github.com">GitHub.com</a>.
On our Linux servers,
we will create a web server out of
what is called a LAMP stack,
which stands for
Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP.
We will use the web server
to setup a basic website and
a bare bones OPAC.
(I'll provide the code for this.)
Then we will learn how to install
and setup two content management systems:
Wordpress and Omeka.
Lastly, we will spend the final
two weeks of the semester
installing and setting up the
open source <a href="https://koha-community.org/">Koha ILS</a>.</p>
<p>Let's get started!</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="using-google-cloud-gcloud"><a class="header" href="#using-google-cloud-gcloud">Using Google Cloud (gcloud)</a></h1>
<p>This section introduces us to <a href="https://cloud.google.com">Google Cloud</a> (gcloud).
We will use this platform to create virtual
instances of the Ubuntu Server Linux operating system.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="using-gcloud-for-virtual-machines"><a class="header" href="#using-gcloud-for-virtual-machines">Using gcloud for Virtual Machines</a></h1>
<h2 id="virtual-machines"><a class="header" href="#virtual-machines">Virtual Machines</a></h2>
<p>Our goal in this section 
is to create a <strong>virtual machine (VM)</strong> <em>instance</em>.
A VM is basically a virtualized operating system
that runs on a host operating system.
That host operating system may also be Linux,
but it could be Windows or macOS.
In short,
when we use virtual machines,
it means instead of installing an operating system
(like Linux, macOS, Windows, etc) on a physical machine,
we use virtual machine software to mimic the process.
The virtual machine, thus, runs on top of our main OS.
It's like an app, where the app is a fully functioning
operating system.</p>
<p>In my Linux Systems Administration course,
we used to use <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> to create
virtual machines with Linux as the virtual operating system.
This worked despite whether you or I were running
Windows, macOS, or Linux as our main operating systems.
VirtualBox is freely available virtualization software,
and using it let students and myself
run Linux as a server
on our own desktops and laptops without changing
the underlying OS on those machines
(e.g., Windows, macOS).</p>
<p>However, even though we virtualize an operating
system when we run a VM,
the underlying operating system and CPU architecture
is still important.
When Apple, Inc launched their new M1 
(ARM-based) chip in 2020,
it created problems for running non ARM-based operating
systems as virtual machines (i.e., x86_64 chips).</p>
<p>Fortunately, we are able to solve that issue
using a third-party virtualization platform.
In this course, that means we're going to use gcloud (via Google),
but there are other options available that you 
can explore on your own.</p>
<h2 id="google-cloud--gcloud"><a class="header" href="#google-cloud--gcloud">Google Cloud / gcloud</a></h2>
<h3 id="google-account"><a class="header" href="#google-account">Google Account</a></h3>
<p>We need to have a Google account to get started with gcloud.
I imagine most of you already have a Google account,
but if not, go ahead and create one at <a href="https://www.google.com">https://www.google.com</a>.</p>
<h3 id="google-cloud-gcloud-project"><a class="header" href="#google-cloud-gcloud-project">Google Cloud (gcloud) Project</a></h3>
<p>Next, you need to use gcloud
to create a Google Cloud project.
Once you've created that project,
you can enable billing for that project,
and then install the gcloud software 
on your local machine.</p>
<p>Follow <strong>Step 1</strong> at the top of the 
<strong><a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install-sdk">Install the gcloud CLI</a></strong> page
to in create a new project.
Also, review the page on
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#gcloud">creating and managing projects</a>.</p>
<p>When you create your project, you can name it anything,
but try to name it something to do with this course.
E.g., I am using the name <strong>sysadmin-418</strong>.
<strong>Avoid using spaces when naming your project.</strong></p>
<p>Then click on the <strong>Create</strong> button,
and leave the organization field set to <strong>No Organization</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="google-billing"><a class="header" href="#google-billing">Google Billing</a></h3>
<p>The second thing to do is to set up
a billing account for your gcloud project.
This does mean there is a cost associated
with this product, but
the good news is that our bills by the end of the semester should
only amount to a few dollars, at most.
<strong><a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install-sdk">Follow Step 2</a></strong> to enable
billing for your new project.
See also the page on how to
<strong><a href="https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/manage-billing-account">create, modify, or close your self-serve Cloud Billing account</a></strong></p>
<h3 id="install-the-latest-gcloud-cli-version"><a class="header" href="#install-the-latest-gcloud-cli-version">Install the latest gcloud CLI version</a></h3>
<p>After you have set up billing,
the next step is to install gcloud on your local machines. 
The <strong><a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install-sdk">Install the gcloud CLI</a></strong> page
provides instructions for different operating systems.</p>
<p>There are installation instructions
for macOS, Windows, Chromebooks, and various Linux distributions.
Follow these instructions closely for the operating system
that you're using.
Note that for macOS,
you have to choose among three different CPU/chip
architectures.
If you have an older macOS machine (before November 2020 or so),
it's likely that you'll select <strong>macOS 64-bit (x86_64)</strong>.
If you have a newer macOS machine,
then it's likely you'll have to select <strong>macOS 64-bit (arm64, Apple M1
silicon).</strong>
It's unlikely that any of you are using a 32-bit macOS operating system.
If you're not sure which macOS system you have,
then let me know and I can help you determine the appropriate platform.
Alternatively, follow these instructions to find your processor information:</p>
<ul>
<li>click on the Apple menu</li>
<li>choose <strong>About This Mac</strong></li>
<li>locate the <strong>Processor</strong> or <strong>Chip</strong> information</li>
</ul>
<p>After you have downloaded the gcloud CLI
for your particular OS and CPU architecture,
you will need to open a command prompt/terminal
on your machines to complete the instructions
the describe how to install the gcloud CLI.
macOS uses the Terminal app,
which can located using Spotlight.
Windows user can use Command.exe,
which can be located by search also.</p>
<p>Windows users will download a regular <strong>.exe</strong> file,
but macOS users will download a <strong>.tar.gz</strong> file.
Since macOS is Unix, you can use the <code>mv</code> command to 
move that file to your <code>$HOME</code> directory.
Then you extract it there using the <code>tar</code> command,
and once extracted
you can change to the directory that it
creates with the <code>cd</code> command.
For example, if you are downloading the X86_64 version
of the gcloud CLI, then you would run the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>mv google-cloud-cli-392.0.0-darwin-x86_64.tar.gz $HOME
tar -xzf google-cloud-cli-392.0.0-darwin-x86_64.tar.gz
cd google-cloud-sdk
</code></pre>
<p>Modify the above commands, as appropriate,
if you're using the M1 version
of the gcloud CLI.</p>
<h3 id="initializing-the-gcloud-cli"><a class="header" href="#initializing-the-gcloud-cli">Initializing the gcloud CLI</a></h3>
<p>Once you have downloaded and installed
the gcloud CLI program,
you need to initialize it on your local machine.
Scroll down on the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install-sdk">install page</a>
to the section titled
<strong>Initializing the gcloud CLI</strong>.
In your terminal/command prompt,
run the initialization command,
per the instructions at the above page:</p>
<pre><code>gcloud init
</code></pre>
<p>And continue to follow the above instructions.</p>
<h2 id="gcloud-vm-instance"><a class="header" href="#gcloud-vm-instance">gcloud VM Instance</a></h2>
<p>Once you've initialized gcloud,
log into <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud Console</a>,
which should take you to the Dashboard page.</p>
<p>Our first goal is to create a <strong>virtual machine (VM)</strong> <em>instance</em>.
As a reminder,
a VM is basically a virtualized operating system.
That means instead of installing an operating system
(like Linux, macOS, Windows, etc) on a physical machine,
software is used to mimic the process. </p>
<p>gcloud offers a number of Linux-based operating systems
to create VMs.
We're going to use the Ubuntu operating system
and specifically the Ubuntu 20.04 LTS version.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ubuntu is a Linux distribution.
A new version of Ubuntu is released every six months.
The 20.04 signifies that this is the April 2020 version.
LTS signifies <strong>Long Term Support</strong>.
LTS versions are released every two years,
and Canonical LTD,
the owners of Ubuntu,
provide standard support for LTS versions for five years.</p>
<p>LTS versions of Ubuntu are also more stable.
Non-LTS versions of Ubuntu only receive nine months of standard support,
and generally apply cutting edge technology,
which is not always desirable for server operating systems.
Each version of Ubuntu has a code name.
20.04 has the code name <strong>Focal Fossa</strong>.
You can see a list of versions, code names, release dates,
and more on Ubuntu's <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases">Releases</a> page.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We will create our VM using the gcloud console.
To do so, follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click the <strong>Select from</strong> drop-down list.</li>
<li>In the window, select the project that you created earlier.</li>
<li>Next, click on <strong>Create a VM</strong>.</li>
<li>Provide a name for your <strong>instance</strong>.
<ul>
<li>E.g., I chose <strong>syslib-2023</strong> (no spaces) </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Under the <strong>Series</strong> dropdown box, make sure <strong>E2</strong> is selected.</li>
<li>Under the <strong>Machine type</strong> dropdown box, select <strong>e2-micro (2 vCPU, 1 GB memory)</strong>
<ul>
<li>This is the lowest cost virtual machine and perfect for our needs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Under <strong>Boot disk</strong>, click on the <strong>Change</strong> button.</li>
<li>In the window, select <strong>Ubuntu</strong> from the <strong>Operating system</strong> dropdown box.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Ubuntu 20.04 LTS x86/64</strong></li>
<li>Leave <strong>Boot disk type</strong> be set to <strong>Balanced persistant disk</strong></li>
<li>Disk size should be set to <strong>10 GB</strong>.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Select</strong> button.</li>
<li>Check the <strong>Allow HTTP Traffic</strong> button</li>
<li>Finally, click on the <strong>Create</strong> button to create your VM instance.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="connect-to-our-vm"><a class="header" href="#connect-to-our-vm">Connect to our VM</a></h2>
<p>After the new VM machine has been created,
we need to connect to it via the command line.
macOS users will connect to it via their Terminal.app.
Windows users can connect to it via their command prompt.</p>
<p>Unlike our past <code>ssh</code> sessions,
we use a slightly different <code>ssh</code> command
to connect to our VMs.
The syntax follows this pattern:</p>
<pre><code>gcloud compute ssh --zone &quot;zone-info&quot; &quot;name-info&quot; --project &quot;project-id&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>The values in the double quotes in the above command
can be located in your Google Cloud console and
in your VM instances section.</p>
<h2 id="update-our-ubuntu-vm"><a class="header" href="#update-our-ubuntu-vm">Update our Ubuntu VM</a></h2>
<p>The VM will include a recently updated version of Ubuntu 20.04,
but it may not be completely updated.
Thus the first thing we need to do is update our machines.
On Ubuntu, we'll use the following two commands,
which you should run also:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt update
sudo apt -y upgrade
</code></pre>
<p>Then type <code>exit</code> to logout and quit the connection to the remote server.</p>
<pre><code>exit
</code></pre>
<h2 id="snapshots"><a class="header" href="#snapshots">Snapshots</a></h2>
<p>Lastly, we have installed a pristine version of Ubuntu,
but it's likely that we will mess something up 
as we work on our systems.
Or it could be that our systems may become compromised
at some point.
Therefore, we want to create a snapshot of our newly
installed Ubuntu server.
This will allow us to restore our server if something
goes wrong later.</p>
<p>To get started:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the left hand navigation panel, click on <strong>Snapshots</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the top of the page, click on <strong>Create Snapshot</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide a name for your snapshot: e.g., <strong>ubuntu-1</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide a description of your snapshot: e.g.,</p>
<p>This is a new install of Ubuntu 20.04.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose your <strong>Source disk</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose a <strong>Location</strong> to store your snapshot.</p>
<ul>
<li>To avoid extra charges, choose <strong>Regional</strong>.</li>
<li>From the dropdown box, select the same location (zone-info) your VM has</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on <strong>Create</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><p style="color:red">Please monitor your billing for this to avoid costs
that you do not want to incur.</p></strong></p>
<h2 id="conclusion-2"><a class="header" href="#conclusion-2">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>Congratulations!
You have just completed your first installation of a Linux server.</p>
<p>To summarize,
in this section,
you learned about and created a VM with gcloud.
This is a lot! 
After this course is completed,
you will be able to fire up a virtual machine
on short notice and deploy websites and more.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="learning-the-command-line"><a class="header" href="#learning-the-command-line">Learning the Command Line</a></h1>
<p>It's obviously more common for people today
to learn how to use a computer via a 
graphical user interface (GUI), but
there are benefits to learning a
command line interface (CLI).
In this section,
we learn some of the basics
of using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)">Bash shell</a> as our CLI.
Our primary goal is to learn how
to use the CLI as a file manager and
to perform some text editing.
However, if you find this interface appealing,
know that Bash is a
<a href="https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/learn-bash-scripting">full-fledged programming language</a>, and
I encourage you to explore it as a scripting language.</p>
<p>There are three reasons,
from a systems administration point of view,
to prefer the CLI over the GUI.
First, the GUI entails extra software, and
the more software we have on a server,
the more resources (memory, CPU, storage, etc)
that software consumes.
We would much rather have our machine's
resources being used to provide the services
we build them to do than to run irrelevant software.
Second, the extra software a GUI requires means
that we expose our systems to additional security risks.
That is, every time we install more software
on our servers,
the server becomes more vulnerable
because all software has bugs.
This means that we want to be
conservative, careful, and protective
of our systems.
This is especially true for production systems.
Third, graphical user interfaces do not provide
a good platform for automation,
at least not remotely as well 
as command line interfaces do.
Working on the command line,
becuase it is a text-based environment,
in what is know as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell">shell</a>,
is a reproducible process.
That is not as easily true in a GUI.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Linux, and
many other Unix-like operating systems,
have the ability to operate without graphical user interfaces.
This is partly the reason why these operating systems
have done so well in the server market.</p>
<p>In this section,
our focus is learning the command line environment.
We will do this using the Bash shell.
We will learn how to use the shell,
how to navigate around the filesystem,
how to perform basic tasks, and
explore other functions and utilities
the shell has to offer.</p>
