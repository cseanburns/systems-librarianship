# What is Systems Librarianship

## Introduction

Of course, let's begin with the question,
what is systems librarianship?
Normally we might go to the literature
to answer a question like this.
Indeed, the literature is helpful,
but it's sparse.
The [LISTA][lista] database only
returns 131 results
with a 45 year coverage
for a search using the thesauri term
**SYSTEMS Librarians**.
I can get more results if I expand
the search query, but
then I get less relevant results, and
the main idea is the same:
this is an understudied area of
librarianship.

It's been that way for a while.
[Susan K. Martin][martin1988]
wrote the following over 35 years ago:

> Of the specialist positions that exist in libraries, none
> is as underexamined as those of the systems
> librarians---the people who identify the needs of the
> library for automated systems, cause these systems to be
> implemented, and analyze the operations of the library (p.
> 57).

Perhaps as a result of this
underexamination,
sometimes there is confusion around
the requirements and skills needed in
this area of librarianship.
Martin (1988) captured this tension
when she wrote the following in 1988,
which is still true today:

> Over the years the library world has argued whether
> systems librarians should be librarians who have learned
> information technologies, or computer experts who have
> learned about libraries (p. 61).

The argument is partly
a matter of jurisdiction.
[Abbott (1998)][abbott1998],
writing on librarianship in the sociology of professions,
illustrated how:

> The future of librarianship thus hinges on what happens to
> the perpetually changing work of the profession in its
> three contexts: the context of larger social and culture

> the context of competing organizations and commodities. To

Essentially, Abbott means that professions,
like librarianship,
are always changing.
The mechanisms for that change are
structural and cultural [(Abbott, 2010)][abbott2010],
but a changing profession means that
its "link of jurisdiction"
(Abbott, 1998, p. 435) changes, too.
It not only changes, but
professions constantly compete with each
other over to adopt new areas
of jurisdiction.
So when we ask,
as Martin (1998) did,
whether librarians should learn
information technologies or whether
computer experts should learn libraries,
I find myself thinking the prior is
more important for libraries
and their patrons.
It means that librarians are expanding
their jurisdiction by also becoming
computer experts rather than
computer experts expanding theirs.

That leads us to the next questions:
what does it mean to be a computer
expert for a systems librarian?
What does a systems librarians need
to do and know?

The answer is that it is a mix.
Some part of the work involves
systems administration, but
that has broad meanings, and
systems librarianship is more specific.
Or, it has a more specific domain:
the domain of libraries and librarianship.

A systems librarian might thus be considered
a library systems administrator.
Under this view, they need to be someone
who knows about libraries,
how libraries work,
what they do,
about their patrons,
what their values are,
and then use that knowledge to build
the infrastructure to support that.

Given this, and the technologies involved,
such work requires constant learning.
[Jordan (2003)][jordan2003] 
identified three areas of learning:

- pre-service education in library schools
- on the job training
- professional development in the form of workshops,
  courses, and conferences (p. 273)

Pre-service, formal education is a small part
of any professional's career,
regardless if that profession is
in medicine, law, or librarianship.
Thus the goal of pre-service
education is to prepare people
to adapt and grow in their fields.
Jordan (2003) wrote that:

> While formal training is undoubtedly important, the
> ability to learn new technologies independently lies at
> the foundation of systems librarians' professional life,
> because they often have to use technologies, or make
> planning decisions about specific technologies, before

Even though Jordan's article
is 20 years old and
the technology has changed a lot,
the basic duties of the systems librarian
remain the same
(Fu, 2014; [Gonzales, 2020][gonzales2020]).
[Wilson (1998)][wilson1998],
as cited in Jordan (2003),
refers to a list of the
"typical responsibilities of systems librarians."
These responsibilities look different today,
because the technology is different,
but conceptually,
they're the same as they were then.
In fact, this work will focus
on a subset of this list that includes:

- integrated library system management
- server management
- documentation
- technology exploration and evaluation (Jordan, 2003, p. 274)

Gonzales (2020) highlights these and
more current areas that include:

- content management systems
- electronic resource management systems
- website redesign
- help and support

Other items on Jordan's (2003) list are
still relevant, but
due to various constraints,
this work will not cover the following
areas:

- network design and management
- desktop computing
- application development
- planning and budget
- specification and purchasing
- miscellaneous technology support
- technical risk management (p. 274)

In short,
this work specifically focuses on
a few of the bigger technical aspects of
systems librarianship.
Other works (or courses) and
other sources will provide learning
opportunities on the more
managerial and administrative functions
of systems librarianship and librarianship, in general.

As Jordan (2003) identified,
there is a lack of formalized training
in systems librarianship in LIS schools.
This is as true today as it was in 2003.
This course was created to address the
lack of that training.
However, it can only be a start.
Technology is constantly changing, and
that means we must always embrace more
informal learning opportunities.
LIS programs are only two or so years
long (if attending full time), but
our careers, hopefully, will span decades.
So all this course can ever be
is just a starting point.

It is a big start, though.
This course should lay a strong foundation for
self-growth and self-education
in the variety of technologies
that we will learn and use here.
Although separate areas of librarianship,
my work (and course) on
[electronic resource management][ermbook]
complement this one in many ways.
For example, this work supports several
parts of the technology section in the
[NASIG Core Competencies for Electronic Resources
Librarians][nasigesr].
It is no coincidence these two areas of
librarianship often overlap or are
assumed in a single librarian position.

## Cloud Computing

Lastly, I want to mention cloud computing.
This has become a major area of change in
the last decade or so.
It used to be more common for librarians
to install their integrated library system software
and store their bibliographic data on their premises.
In the last ten years,
there has been more migration to the cloud,
which means that both the integrated library system
software and the bibliographic data are stored off-site.
[Liu & Cai (2013)][liu2013] highlight the beginning
of this trend toward cloud computing
that continues to play a large role in
systems librarianship [(Naveed et al., 2021)][naveed2021].
As Liu and Cai note:

> Systems librarians used to make their livings by managing
> hosted library systems. This situation is silently
> changing with the library systems moving onto the cloud
> (p. 26).

This trend has changed some aspects of
systems librarianship.
It means that systems librarians,
while still a technical area of librarianship,
need to work more closely with the vendors
who themselves are hosting library systems.
However, the trend does not erase all
locally hosted solutions.
Many libraries and other information agencies
continue to support local collections and
will either host those locally or work
to get the bibliographic information for those
collections ingested into their cloud-based
integrated library systems.

## Conclusion

The remainder of the course
will be more technical and
will prepare you to work and understand the
systems that support the modern library.
We will cover a lot, too!
We will begin with setting up
virtual machine instances on Google Cloud.
We will use a distribution of the Linux
operating system for these virtual machines.
We will then learn the basics of the
Linux command line.
Next, we will learn how to use
the version control system called ``git``.
We will use ``git`` to document our work flows and
push that documentation to [GitHub.com][github].
On our Linux servers,
we will create a web server out of
what is called a LAMP stack,
which stands for
Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP.
We will use the web server
to setup a basic website and
a bare bones OPAC.
(I'll provide the code for this.)
Then we will learn how to install
and setup two content management systems:
Wordpress and Omeka.
Lastly, we will spend the final
two weeks of the semester
installing and setting up the
open source [Koha ILS][kohails].

Let's get started!
