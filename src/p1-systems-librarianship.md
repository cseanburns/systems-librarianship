## Introduction

The goal of this book is to
provide a technical introduction to
the basics of systems librarianship
using Linux.
The book is used alongside a course
on systems librarianship that the author teaches.

The course and book goals include:

1. how to use the Linux command line in order to become more efficient computer
   users and more comfortable with using computers in general;
2. how to use cloud computing resources and create virtual machines;
3. how to manage projects using Git and GitHub;
4. how to create a LAMP server, websites, and create a bare bones OPAC;
5. how to install and configure content management systems, and;
6. how to install and configure an integrated library system.
7. to foster self-efficacy with computers and an enthusiasm for foundational
   computer technologies

## About This Book

The Systems Librarianship course is
a brand new course (2023).
I created the course to help future
and current librarians become proficient
in the kinds of technology used to manage
and provide electronic resources.

Since I use this book for my
Systems Librarianship course,
which I will likely teach each spring semester,
this book will be a live document.
Each semester that I teach this course,
I will update the content in order
to address changes in the technology and to
edit for clarity when I discover some aspect
of the book causes confusion or
does not provide enough information.

A small part of this book will draw from
my course on
[Linux Systems Administration][linuxsysadmin],
which I teach in the fall semesters.

This book is not a
comprehensive introduction to
systems librarianship.
For example,
this book does not cover software coding nor
managerial duties, like issuing
requests for proposals for software products,
or budgeting.
It is designed as an entry level course in
the technical aspects of systems librarianship,
and it is meant to go hand-in-hand with 
other courses taught in our program.
That includes my course on
[electronic resource management][ermbook]
but also other courses that my colleagues teach.
