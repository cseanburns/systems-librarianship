# Project Management with Git and GitHub

Every major software project
requires management.
This is because a lot of people
are often involved in these projects and
it takes some coordination for them
to write the many thousands of lines of
software code,
which also requires management.

[Git][git] and GitHub are two
of the most popular technologies
used to manage such software projects.
However, they can also be used for
other purposes,
such as for technical documentation.
Providing good documentation is the
key to being able to build on prior work,
to make adjustments to our workflows,
to recall the details of some process, and
for students,
it can help in retention and reflection.
In the remainder of the semester,
we will begin to install and configure
some complicated pieces of software.
In order to better understand what
we will be doing,
it will be helpful to document
our processes.

Specifically,
we will use Git and GitHub to
begin to document and take notes
as we install the Apache2 web server,
the PHP scripting language, and
the MySQL relational database.
These three technologies,
plus the Linux operating system,
form what is called the
[LAMP stack][lampstack].
This *stack* forms the basis of
most modern web applications.

I recently had the opportunity to
sit down and interview
[ChatGPT][chatgpt],
the artificial intelligent chat agent
that has made headlines in recent weeks.
I wanted to see how ChatGPT would respond
to some questions about how Git and GitHub
are used.
I am, of course,
being somewhat *cheeky*, but
the reason that something like
ChatGPT works at all is because
it relies on data from
across the web;
that is, it relies on documentation.

I asked ChatGPT two, admittedly,
leading questions.
I think it's responses are on
the mark.

Me: Why are Git and GitHub good tools for project management?

This was its response:

> Git and GitHub are great tools for project management for
> several reasons:
>
> Version control: Git is a distributed version control
> system that allows developers to track changes in the
> codebase over time. It provides a history of all changes
> made to the code, allowing developers to track down bugs
> and revert to previous versions of the code if needed.
> This makes it easy to collaborate with other developers,
> as everyone can work on the same codebase without
> interfering with each other's work.
>
> Collaboration: GitHub is a web-based platform that allows
> multiple developers to work on the same project
> simultaneously. It provides tools for collaboration such
> as pull requests, code reviews, and issue tracking. This
> makes it easy for developers to collaborate and
> communicate with each other, share code, and make changes
> to the codebase.
>
> Documentation: GitHub provides tools for documentation,
> including a wiki and a README file. These tools allow
> developers to document the project's features,
> installation instructions, and other details. This makes
> it easy for new developers to get up to speed with the
> project and for non-developers to understand the project's
> features and functionality.
>
> Continuous Integration and Deployment: GitHub integrates
> with several continuous integration and deployment tools
> such as Travis CI, CircleCI, and Jenkins. These tools
> automate the build, test, and deployment process, ensuring
> that changes to the codebase are thoroughly tested before
> they are deployed to production.
>
> Community: GitHub has a large community of developers who
> contribute to open source projects. Developers can use
> GitHub to showcase their work and collaborate with other
> developers on open source projects. This allows developers
> to learn from each other, build their portfolios, and
> contribute to the open source community.

Me: Then I asked a follow up question: "How might
non-programmers use Git and GitHub?" This was its response:

> Git and GitHub are primarily used by developers for
> version control and collaboration, but non-programmers can
> also use these tools for various purposes. Here are some
> examples:
>
> Documentation: GitHub provides a platform for creating and
> sharing documentation. Non-programmers can use this
> platform to write and maintain documentation for their
> projects or organizations. For example, a technical writer
> can use GitHub to collaborate with developers and create
> technical documentation.
>
> Project management: GitHub provides tools for issue
> tracking and project management. Non-programmers can use
> these tools to manage projects and track progress. For
> example, a project manager can create and assign tasks,
> track progress, and communicate with team members.
>
> Content management: GitHub can be used as a content
> management system for non-programming projects. For
> example, a marketing team can use GitHub to manage content
> for their website or social media channels.
>
> Collaboration: GitHub can be used as a collaboration
> platform for non-programming projects. For example, a team
> working on a research project can use GitHub to
> collaborate on data analysis and share findings.
>
> Education: GitHub can be used in education for version
> control, collaboration, and project management. For
> example, a teacher can use GitHub to teach students how to
> collaborate on group projects, manage tasks, and share
> documents.
>
> In summary, Git and GitHub can be used by non-programmers
> for various purposes, such as documentation, project
> management, content management, collaboration, and
> education.
