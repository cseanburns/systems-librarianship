# Conclusion

Hopefully this textbook helped you build a strong foundation in server-side systems administration and web development for libraries.
The skills covered here are applicable to all library types, including academic, public, school, special, and more.

To summarize, we began by learning how to navigate the Google Cloud console and use it to set up an Ubuntu Linux server.
From there, we developed fluency with the Linux command line and explored tools like command line text editors,
search utilities like `grep`, and package managers for updating, installing, and managing software.

We gained experience using Git and GitHub for version control and documentation.
Then we moved into hands-on projects by building a basic LAMP server and creating a bare bones library system.
This led us to develop more complicated library systems using three major platforms&mdash;WordPress, Omeka, and Koha&mdash;and
connecting them to form a unified web presence that mirrors library practice.

As you wrap up your work, don't forget to stop and delete all of your virtual machines in your Google Cloud project to avoid ongoing billing.
But I hope you continue to explore how to use virtual machines on Google Cloud or other cloud hosting solutions for library purposes.
