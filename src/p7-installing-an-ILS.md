# Installing an ILS

In the last section,
we built a WordPress site that functions as
our library's front-facing presence, and
then we built an Omeka site that could serve as
our library's digital library.
In this section,
we complete our infrastructure building by installing
the [Koha ILS][kohails].

Koha is a free and open source library system that
provides modules for patron accounts, circulation,
cataloging, serials, an OPAC, and more.
The process of installing and using Koha is more
complicated than the processes we used to installing
and using WordPress and Omeka.
This is because Koha,
like other ILS software,
is a complex project that must provide a lot of different
functionality for a library and its patrons.
Fortunately, the documentation makes the process pretty
straightforward.
We will rely on that documentation and other resources
to install Koha and complete our library's interconnected web presence.
