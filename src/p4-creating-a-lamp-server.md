# Creating a LAMP Server

In this section,
we learn how to set up a LAMP
(Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack.
This stack is a common open source pattern for hosting
database-backed websites and applications.
Linux provides the operating system, Apache serves HTTP requests,
PHP runs server-side code, and MySQL stores application data
(often MariaDB in modern distributions).
Together they enable us to create a web server
that provides extra functionality via PHP and MySQL,
both of which are required to run
content management systems and
integrated library systems.
