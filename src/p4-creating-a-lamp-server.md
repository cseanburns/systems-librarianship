# Creating a LAMP Server

In this section, we learn how to set up a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack.
This stack represents a suite of open source software commonly used to host database-backed websites and applications.
Specifically, Linux provides the operating system, Apache serves HTTP requests, PHP runs server-side code, and
MySQL stores application data (often MariaDB in modern distributions).
Together, these applications provide the functionality needed to serve content management systems,
like *WordPress*, as well as integrated library systems, like *Koha*.
