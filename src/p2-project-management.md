# Project Management

This course involves working
towards a final project
that will lead us
to install two content management systems
and an integrated library system.

To accomplish this,
we will need
to set up Linux servers.
We will use Google Cloud for this purpose.
With Google Cloud,
we can create what are
called virtual machines
that run full-fledged operating systems.
We will work with Linux,
and in particular,
the Ubuntu distribution of Linux,
to complete our project.

We will also want
to document our work.
To do that,
we will use [git][git],
which is a version control system,
and [GitHub][github],
an online platform
for hosting `git` repositories.
Using `git`,
we can collaborate,
share documentation and code,
and more.

## Using Google Cloud (gcloud)

The first section
in this chapter
introduces us to
[Google Cloud][gcloud],
which I'll often refer to as **gcloud**.
We will use this platform
to create virtual instances
of the Ubuntu Server Linux operating system.
Once we create our own
Ubuntu virtual machines,
we will connect to them
via the command line.
I have written some
helpful software to help
you learn the command line language,
specifically,
the [Bash shell][bash_shell].
Just about everything
we'll do this semester
will happen via the Bash shell.

## Git and GitHub

The second section
in this chapter
introduces us to `git` and GitHub.
`git` and GitHub are
primarily used for software management.
Every major software project
requires managing the codebase,
collaborations,
documentation, and more.
Many people may be involved
in these projects,
and it takes coordination
for them to write
the many thousands of
lines of software code,
which also requires management.

Although `git` and GitHub
are primarily used
for this purpose,
our goal is to use them
to document our work,
much like this book,
which has its own
[GitHub repository or repo][syslib_github].
This documentation covers
the processes involved
in learning Google Cloud,
`git` and GitHub, Linux, and more.
Therefore,
in the next section,
we'll learn how
to create a new repo on GitHub,
use the web interface to add notes,
and write our notes using Markdown,
an easy-to-understand and
use *markup* language to format our text.

Providing good documentation
is key to being able
to build on prior work,
make adjustments to our workflows,
recall the details of some process, and,
for students,
it can help in
retention and reflection.
In the remainder of the semester,
we will begin
to install and configure
some complicated pieces of software.
In order to better understand
what we will be doing,
it will be helpful
to document our processes.

## Attending to Detail

As we begin to work on
the more technical aspects
of this book and course,
it will be important to
remain **attentive to details**.
Many people who are new
to this kind of work often
stumble over the details,
like a missing period,
incorrect capitalization,
and more.
To learn how to pay
**attention to the details**,
work slowly and
read any messages,
including error messages,
the screen prints out
in response to your commands.
