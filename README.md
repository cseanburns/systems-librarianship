# Systems Librarianship

This repo contains materials
for a course on systems librarianship
that started in the Spring 2023 semester.

Version 1 content reflects
the course after the
Spring 2023 semester.
Version 2 will be created
at the end of
the Spring 2024 semester.

The **src/** directory contains markdown files.
These files are converted into a book format
using [mdbook][mdBook].

The resulting output is hosted on my website at:

[https://cseanburns.github.io/systems-librarianship/](https://cseanburns.github.io/systems-librarianship/)

## To Do for Spring 2025

- based on student feedback, add an additional lecture on using MySQL. Some ideas:
    - creating more structured records
    - creating tables using third normal form, perhaps

## Contributions

I accept revisions to this work.
I will review minor revisions.
Major revisions,
including re-organization of the material
or new content,
would require a discussion first.
