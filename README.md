# Systems Librarianship

This repo contains materials for a course on systems librarianship that started in the Spring 2023 semester.

New versions of this work will be released at the end of each semester I teach the corresponding course:

Version 1: Spring 2023 semester.
Version 2: Spring 2024 semester.

The [`src/`][src_syslib] directory contains the markdown files.
These files are converted into a book format using [mdBook][mdbook].
The resulting output is hosted on my website at:

[https://cseanburns.github.io/systems-librarianship/](https://cseanburns.github.io/systems-librarianship/)

## Contributions

I accept revisions to this work.
I will review minor revisions.
Major revisions, including re-organization of the material or new content, would require a discussion first.
Feel free to fork this work.
