# Systems Librarianship

This repo contains materials that I'm creating on systems
librarianship starting in the Spring 2023 semester.

The **src/** directory contains markdown files.
These files are converted into a book format
using [mdbook][mdBook].

The resulting output is hosted on my website at:
