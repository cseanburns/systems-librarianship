# Systems Librarianship

This repo contains materials
for a course on systems librarianship
that started in the Spring 2023 semester.

Version 1 content reflects
the course after the
Spring 2023 semester.
Version 2 will be created
at the end of
the Spring 2024 semester.

The **src/** directory contains markdown files.
These files are converted into a book format
using [mdbook][mdBook].

The resulting output is hosted on my website at:
